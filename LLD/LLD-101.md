## Introduction to Low-Level Design (LLD)
Low-Level Design (LLD) principles has three goals and and are based on SOLID, OOPS and Design pattern principles

## Three Goals for Low-Level Design
1. Transparent and Readable:
   - LLD aims to make code transparent and readable, ensuring that it is easily understandable by developers.
   - Clean and well-structured code enhances maintainability and reduces bugs.

2. Extensible:
   - LLD enables the system to be easily extended with new features or functionality.
   - Design decisions should consider future requirements and support seamless modifications.

3. Testable:
   - LLD promotes testability by making components independent and isolated.
   - Well-designed interfaces and modular components facilitate unit testing and integration testing.

## SOLID Principles and Java Example
During the session, we discussed SOLID principles and their relevance in LLD. Here's an overview along with a Java example:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - A class should have only one reason to change.
   - Each class should have a single responsibility and should be focused on doing one thing well.
   - Example: In a banking system, the `Account` class should be responsible for managing account-related operations such as deposits and withdrawals.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Existing code should not be modified to accommodate new features; instead, it should be extended through inheritance or interfaces.
   - Example: In a shape hierarchy, the `Shape` class can be extended to create new shapes (e.g., `Rectangle`, `Triangle`) without modifying the existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - The behavior of the subclass should adhere to the behavior defined by the superclass.
   - Example: If we have an `Animal` superclass and a `Bird` subclass, any code that expects an `Animal` should work correctly with a `Bird` object.

## OOPs Concepts and Java Example
We explored key OOPs concepts and their significance in LLD. Here are the concepts discussed:

1. Inheritance:
   - Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from their parent class.
   - Example: We can have a `Bird` class as a parent class with common properties and methods shared by all bird types.

2. Abstraction:
   - Abstraction focuses on defining behaviors without providing implementation details.
   - It allows us to work with higher-level concepts and hide complex implementation complexities.
   - Example: A fan can be switched on using either a voice command (Alexa) or a physical button press. The underlying implementation details are abstracted, and the user interacts with a simplified interface.

3 . Interface vs. Abstraction:
   - Interfaces define contracts or behaviors that classes must implement.
   - Abstraction hides complex implementation details and provides a simplified view of the system.
   - Example: In the case of birds, we can define an `interface Flyable` with a `fly()` method, which can be implemented by specific bird classes like `Kite` or `Superman`.

4. Polymorphism:
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
   - Example: We can have a `Bird` reference variable that can hold an object of the `Eagle` class, demonstrating polymorphic behavior

## Key Takeaways
- LLD focuses on modularity, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Modularity enhances code reusability and maintainability by dividing the system into independent modules.
- Encapsulation protects data and behavior by controlling access through well-defined methods.
- Abstraction hides complex implementation details, providing a simplified view of the system.
- Examples in Java illustrated the application of LLD principles.
