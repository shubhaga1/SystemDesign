**Title: Understanding Functional and Procedural Programming in Java**

Introduction:
In this GitHub post, we will explore the concepts of functional programming and procedural programming in the context of Java. We will provide examples in Java to demonstrate how each paradigm can be implemented, discuss their respective pros and cons, and highlight situations where each style is commonly used.

### Functional Programming in Java

Example: Sum of Even Numbers
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class FunctionalExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
        
        // Using functional programming to calculate the sum of even numbers
        int sum = numbers.stream()
                         .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                         .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                         .sum();
        
        System.out.println("Sum of even numbers: " + sum);
    }
}
```

Pros of Functional Programming in Java:
- Concise and expressive code
- Immutable data
- Parallel processing

Cons of Functional Programming in Java:
- Learning curve
- Performance overhead
- Interoperability challenges

### Procedural Programming in Java

Example: Finding the Maximum Number
```java
public class ProceduralExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {12, 7, 21, 4, 9, 15, 18, 3};
        
        // Using procedural programming to find the maximum number
        int max = numbers[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            if (numbers[i] > max) {
                max = numbers[i];
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println("Maximum number: " + max);
    }
}
```

Pros of Procedural Programming in Java:
- Easy to understand and maintain
- Mutable state
- Seamless integration with object-oriented code

Cons of Procedural Programming in Java:
- Code complexity
- Limited code reuse
- Lack of parallelism

### Choosing the Right Paradigm

Functional programming is well-suited for scenarios that require immutability, higher-order functions, and parallel processing. It is commonly used in areas such as data processing, concurrency, and distributed systems. On the other hand, procedural programming shines in situations where a sequential step-by-step approach is sufficient, especially in smaller projects or when integrating with existing object-oriented codebases.

In conclusion, understanding both functional and procedural programming paradigms in Java allows developers to choose the right approach based on the specific requirements and characteristics of their projects, promoting code maintainability, readability, and efficiency.
