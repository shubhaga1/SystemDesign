# Search Techniques: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

## Introduction
Search techniques play a crucial role in information retrieval, text mining, and search engines. One such technique is Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which is used to measure the importance of a term within a document corpus. TF-IDF combines two factors: the term frequency (TF), which represents how frequently a term appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency (IDF), which measures the rarity of a term across the document corpus.

## Term Frequency (TF)
Term Frequency (TF) measures how frequently a term appears in a document. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of occurrences of a term to the total number of words in the document. TF assigns higher weights to terms that appear more frequently in a document, assuming they are more relevant to the document's content.

## Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measures the rarity or importance of a term across the entire document corpus. IDF is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents to the number of documents containing the term. Terms that appear in a few documents are considered more important as they can help differentiate or define those specific documents.

## TF-IDF Calculation
TF-IDF combines the TF and IDF values to assess the significance of a term within a document corpus. The formula for calculating TF-IDF is as follows:

```
TF-IDF = TF * IDF
```

Higher TF-IDF scores indicate that a term is both frequent within a document and rare across the corpus, suggesting it carries important information specific to that document.

## Application of TF-IDF
TF-IDF is widely used in various applications, including:

1. Information Retrieval: TF-IDF is used in search engines to rank and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. Documents with higher TF-IDF scores for the query terms are considered more relevant.

2. Text Mining: TF-IDF is employed in text classification, clustering, and topic modeling tasks. It helps identify important features or keywords that distinguish documents or define specific topics.

3. Document Similarity: TF-IDF can be used to measure the similarity between documents. By comparing the TF-IDF vectors of two documents, similarity scores can be calculated to identify related or similar documents.

4. Keyword Extraction: TF-IDF aids in extracting keywords or important terms from a document. Terms with higher TF-IDF scores are likely to be more representative of the document's content.

TF-IDF provides a quantitative measure of term importance, enabling effective search and analysis of textual data.

Remember, TF-IDF is just one of the many techniques used in information retrieval and text analysis, and its effectiveness can vary depending on the specific task and domain.
