Today's Learning: Low-Level Design (LLD) Principles and Key Takeaways

## Introduction to Low-Level Design (LLD)
In today's session, we explored the world of Low-Level Design (LLD) and delved into its principles. LLD is an important aspect of software development that focuses on the detailed design of individual components within a system.

## LLD Principles
During the session, we discussed three key principles of Low-Level Design:

1. Modularity:
   - LLD emphasizes breaking down a system into modular components.
   - Each module should have a single responsibility and well-defined boundaries.
   - Promotes code reusability and maintainability.

2. Encapsulation:
   - LLD focuses on encapsulating the data and behavior of components.
   - Access modifiers, such as private and protected, control the visibility of variables and methods.
   - Ensures controlled and secure access to the internal state of components.

3. Abstraction:
   - LLD promotes abstraction to hide complex implementation details.
   - Abstract classes and interfaces are used to define common behaviors and contracts.
   - Provides a simplified view of the system, allowing flexibility and loose coupling.

## Examples in Java
To illustrate the principles of LLD, we provided examples in Java:

- Modularity Example:
  - Demonstrated the modular design of a system by creating separate classes for User Service, Payment Service, and Product Service.
  - Each class contained methods specific to its responsibility.

- Encapsulation Example:
  - Showcased a Bank Account class with private variables (e.g., balance) and public methods (e.g., deposit, withdraw, getBalance) to control access to the account's data.
  - External code can interact with the account only through the defined methods, ensuring controlled access.

- Abstraction Example:
  - Introduced an abstract Shape class with an abstract draw() method.
  - Subclasses, such as Circle and Square, provided their own implementations of the draw() method.
  - By interacting with shapes through the Shape class, we achieve abstraction and decouple the code from specific shape implementations.

## Key Takeaways
- LLD focuses on modularity, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Modularity enhances code reusability and maintainability by dividing the system into independent modules.
- Encapsulation protects data and behavior by controlling access through well-defined methods.
- Abstraction hides complex implementation details, providing a simplified view of the system.
- Examples in Java illustrated the application of LLD principles.
